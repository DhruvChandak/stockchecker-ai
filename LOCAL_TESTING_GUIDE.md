# StockPilot AI Local Testing Guide

This guide walks through the full demo on web and mobile.

## 1. Start the Backend and Demo Data

Preferred path:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The backend seeds demo data automatically on startup.

Demo users all use password: `password123`

| Role to test | Email |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | `owner@demo.com` |
| Admin | `admin@demo.com` |
| Manager | `manager@demo.com` |
| Warehouse staff | `warehouse@demo.com` |
| Sales staff | `sales@demo.com` |
| Purchase manager | `purchase@demo.com` |
| Accountant | `accountant@demo.com` |
| Viewer | `viewer@demo.com` |
| Auditor | `auditor@demo.com` |
| Dealer/customer portal | `ravi@demo.com` |

Backend URLs:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Swagger: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- Adminer: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`

If you already started the app before this guide was added, restart the backend once. The seeder is idempotent and will add the extra demo data for Tally Hub, Data Quality, Dead Stock, and Reorder screens.

## 2. Start the Web App

Temporary web-only demo mode, no Docker/backend/PostgreSQL:

```bash
start-web-demo.bat
```

This mode uses in-browser dummy API responses so you can test the web UI quickly. It is not connected to the Java backend.

Windows shortcut:

```bash
start-web.bat
```

Manual command:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Keep the web terminal open. If Chrome says `127.0.0.1 refused to connect`, the web server is not running.

## 3. Web Test Checklist

Log in as `owner@demo.com` / `password123`.

Use the role account buttons on the login page to test the access-control panels. Expected quick checks:

- `owner@demo.com`: full business menu including settings, imports, reports, audit logs, and AI Assistant.
- `admin@demo.com`: almost full business menu, without billing ownership behavior.
- `manager@demo.com`: operations, forecasts, imports, dead stock, data quality, reports, and AI Assistant.
- `warehouse@demo.com`: product and stock operations only; no profit, purchase, import commit, reports export, or settings.
- `sales@demo.com`: products, stock availability, sales, and customers; no purchase-cost or profit views.
- `purchase@demo.com`: purchases, suppliers, forecasts, reorder suggestions, and draft purchase orders.
- `accountant@demo.com`: sales/purchases/customer outstanding, reports export, profit insight, and audit logs.
- `viewer@demo.com`: read-only dashboard/product/stock/report-style views.
- `auditor@demo.com`: broad read-only audit/report view.
- `ravi@demo.com`: dealer portal only.

   - Confirm duplicate Maggi-style products are listed.
   - Click `Apply` on a missing-field suggestion.
   - Try `Merge into canonical` on a duplicate group.

4. Products

     `backend/src/main/resources/sample-imports/`
   - Try `sample-products.csv`, `sample-sales.csv`, or `sample-tally-stock-items.xml`.
   - Apply mapping, validate, preview, and commit.

11. AI Assistant
   - Ask: `Why did my profit drop this month?`
   - Ask: `What should I reorder this week?`
   - Ask: `Which imported products need cleanup?`
   - Confirm answers reference actual data, not static text.

12. Dealer Portal
   - Sign out.
   - Log in as `ravi@demo.com` / `password123`.
   - Open `/portal`.
   - Add products to cart and place a sales order.
   - Confirm outstanding, orders, and invoices sections render.

## 4. Start the Mobile App

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

For Android emulator:

```bash
set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8080
npm start
```

For Expo Go on a physical phone on the same Wi-Fi:

```bash
set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:8080
npm start
```

Find your laptop IP with:

```bash
ipconfig
```

For Expo web preview on the same machine:

```bash
set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
npm run web
```

## 5. Mobile Test Checklist

Log in as `owner@demo.com` / `password123`.

Test these screens:

1. Dashboard
   - Pull to refresh.
   - Confirm summary numbers load.

2. Product Search
   - Search `Maggi`.
   - Try manual barcode input if camera is unavailable.

3. Stock In

   - Confirm mock extraction response appears.

9. Settings
   - Confirm API connection details and sign-out flow.

## 6. Common Fixes

- Web-only demo says refused to connect: start `start-web-demo.bat` and keep it open, then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Full web app loads but data calls fail: backend is not running on `8080`.
- Mobile emulator cannot call backend: use `http://10.0.2.2:8080`.
- Physical phone cannot call backend: use your laptop LAN IP and allow firewall access.
- Backend demo data not visible: restart backend once after pulling latest code.
